	<h3>Google Docs</h3>

	<p>
		Import excerpts from a Google Doc or multiple Google Docs. The Google
		Doc must be shared with the service account associated with this site. If
		it isn't apparent how to do that, it's because the creators of this
		software haven't gotten around to making it apparent, yet. Sorry.
